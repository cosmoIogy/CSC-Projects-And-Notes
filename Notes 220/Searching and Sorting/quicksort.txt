choose the left most number and compare all the numbers to the left (bigger) and to the right(smaller) of it.

if all the numbers to the left and right of it are in the right spot then that number is sorted

if not,
approach the list from the left to find the first largest number and from the right to find the first smaller value. then swap these numbers.
then approach from the left and the right from the new L and R.
when are L and R meet then the pivot moves
